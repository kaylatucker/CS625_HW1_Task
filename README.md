👉 To demonstrate basic Git/GitHub knowledge (all you'll need for this class), perform the following tasks:

* create a new repository in your account at GitHub.com - *this is not the repo that is created for your class work, but is a separate repo that you create*
* add two files that can contain anything you want
     * README.md and hello.txt
* clone the repo locally (on your local machine)
* make and commit changes to one of the files in the repo locally
* push the changes back to GitHub
* open the repo in your web browser at GitHub.com
* make and commit changes to the other file in the repo on GitHub.com
* pull changes back to your local machine
